# SubstanceUse-SOC456
Research project looking at trends of substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic across Canada. Specific attention was given to looking at correlations of alcohol and cannabis use and their relation to different socioeconomic markers

## Abstract
The topic of this paper looks at the correlation between socioeconomic status (SES) and substance use. Historically, SES has been significantly linked to substance use, with certain substances, such as alcohol, being more prevalent among people with higher SES and cannabis prevalent among those with lower SES. Henceforth, the purpose of this research project was to look at factors like employment status and education level, which are markers for SES, and are they markers for alcohol and cannabis use during the COVID-19 global pandemic? The reason why this topic is important to study is that the current research on this subject matter, specifically during the midst of the pandemic, is lacking. The scope for this research project was limited to a sample size of n = 3829 Canadians over the age of 15 who took part in the *Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 6* and excluded individuals living on indigenous reserves or remote locations. Using this survey data, a statistical analysis using logistic regression showed that while factors like employment status and education level were statistically significant predictors for alcohol and cannabis use, they were not the only ones resulting in relatively weak correlations between employment/ education and alcohol/cannabis use.
